Changes:

v1.3 - 11/20/14

* Changed structure info to add BYTE $000A as number of heads.  This has not been used
  in any version of the SCP software, but will be starting with v1.6.

v1.4 - 11/21/14

* Redefined the HEADS definition and added it to BYTE $000A in IFF defines.

The SuperCard Pro image file format will handle flux level images for any type of disk,
be it 8", 5.25", 3.5", 3", GCR, FM, MFM, etc.

All longwords are in little endian format.  The words used for the flux length in the
actual flux data are in big endian format... sorry, that's just how it worked out for
the SuperCard Pro hardware.

All offsets are the start of the file (byte 0) unless otherwise stated.  The .scp image
consists of a disk definition header, the track data header offset table, and the flux
data for each track, which is preceeded by Track Data Header.  The format is described
below:

BYTES 0x00-0x02 contains the ASCII of "SCP" as the first 3 bytes. If this is not found,
then the file is not ours.

BYTE 0x03 is the version/revision as a byte.  This is encoded as (Version<<4|Revision),
so that 0x39= version 3.9 of the format.  This is the version number of the SCP imaging
software that created this image.

BYTE 0x04 is the disk type and represents the type of disk for the image (see disk types
in the defines).

BYTE 0x05 is the number of revolutions, which is how many revolutions for each track is
contained in the image.

BYTES 0x06 and 0x07 are the start track and end track bytes.  Tracks are numbered 0-165,
which is a maximum of 166 tracks (83 tracks with top/bottom).

BYTE 0x08 is the FLAGS byte.  This byte contains information about how the image was
produced.  The bits are defined as follows:

Bit 0 - INDEX, cleared if the image did not use the index mark for queuing tracks
               set is the image used the index mark to queue tracks
			   
Bit 1 - TPI, cleared if the drive is a 48TPI drive
             set if the drive is a 96TPI drive
			 
Bit 2 - RPM, cleared if the drive is a 300 RPM drive
             set if the drive is a 360 RPM drive

Bit 3 - TYPE, cleared for preservation quality image
              set if flux has been normalized, reducing quality

Bit 4 - MODE, cleared if the image is read-only
              set if the image is read/write capable
  
FLAGS bit 0 is used to determine when the reading of flux data started.  If this bit is
set then the flux data was read immediately after the index pulse was detected.  If
this bit is clear then the flux data was read starting at some random location on the
track.

FLAGS bit 1 is used for determining the type of 5.25" drive was used.  Does not apply
to any 3.5" drives.

FLAGS bit 2 is used to determine the approximate RPM of the drive.  When FLAGS bit 0 is
clear, the index pulse is simulated using either a 166.6667ms (360 RPM) or 200ms (300 RPM)
index pulse.

FLAGS bit 3 is used to determine if the image was made with the full resolution possible
or if the image quality was reduced using a normalization routine that is designed to
reduce the file size when compressed.

FLAGS bit 4 is used to determine if the image is read-only or read/write capable.  Most
images will be read-only (write protected) for emulation usage.  The read/write capable
images contain padded space to allow the track to change size within the image.  Only a
single revolution is allowed when the TYPE bit is set (read/write capable).

BYTE 0x09 is the width of the bit cell time.  Normally this is always 0 which means
16 bits wide, but if the value is non-zero then it represents the number of bits for
each bit cell entry.  For example, if this byte was set to 8, then each bit cell entry
would be 8 bits wide, not the normal 16 bits.  This is for future expansion, and may never
be actually used.

BYTE 0x0A is the head number(s) contained in the image.  This value is either 0, 1 or 2.
If the value is 0 then both heads are contained in the image, which has always been the
default for all SCP images (except C64).  A value of 1 means just side 0 (bottom) is
contained in the image, and a value of 2 means just side 1 (top) is contained in the image.

BYTE 0x0B is reserved for future use.

BYTES 0x0C-0x0F are the 32 bit checksum of data starting from offset 0x10 through the
end of the image file.  Checksum is standard addition, with a wrap beyond 32 bits
rolling over.  A value of 0x00000000 is used when FLAGS bit 4 (MODE) is set, as no checksum
is calculated for read/write capable images.

BYTES 0x10-0x2A7 are a table of longwords with each entry being a offset to a Track Data
Header (TDH) for each track that is stored in the image.  The table is always sequential.
There is an entry for every track, with up to 166 tracks supported.  This means that disk
images of up to 83 tracks with sides 0/1 are possible.  If no flux data for a track is
present, then the entry will contain a longword of zeros (0x00000000).  The 1st TDH
will probably start at offset 0x000002A8, but could technically start anywhere in the file
because all entries are offset based, so track data does not have to be in any order.  This
was done so you could append track data to the file and change the header to point to the
appended data.  For simplicity it is recommended that you follow the normal image format
shown below, with all tracks in sequential order.  The SuperCard Pro imaging software will
always create a disk with all tracks and revolutions stored sequentially.


TRACK DATA HEADER (TDH) INFO:
----------------------------

As stated, each entry is an offset to a Track Data Header.  That header contains
information about the flux data for that track.  To help recover corrupt files,
each entry has its own header starting with "TRK" as the first 3 bytes of the header and
the track number as the 4th byte.

When imaging a single side only, the track data header entry will skip every other entry.

BYTES 0x00-0x02 ASCII 'TRK'

BYTE 0x03 contains the track number (0-165).  For single sided disks, tracks 0-42 (48TPI)
or 0-82 (96TPI) are used.  For double-sided disks, the actual track number is this value
divided by 2.  The remainder (0 or 1) is the head.  0 represents the bottom head and
1 represents the top head.  For example, 0x0B would be 11/2 = track 5, head 1 (top).
Likewise, 0x50 would be 80/2 = track 40, head 0 (bottom).

Starting at BYTE 0x04 are three longwords for each revolution that is stored.  Typically,
a maximum of five sets of three longwords are stored using the SuperCard Pro's imaging
program, but this is user defined and can vary from image to image.  Using BYTE 0x05 of
the main file header, you can determine the number of sets of three longwords (one for each
revolution stored).  The three longwords for each entry are described below:

BYTES 0x04-0x07 contain the duration of the 1st revolution.  This is the time from index
pulse to index pulse.  This will be either ~360RPMs or ~300 RPMs depending the drive.
It is important to have this exact time as it is necessary when writing an image back to a
real disk.  The index time is a value in nanoseconds/25ns for one revolution.  Multiply
the value by 25 to get the exact time value in nanoseconds.

BYTES 0x08-0x0B contain the length of the track in bitcells (flux transitions).  If a
16 bit width is used (selected above), then this value *2 will be the total number of
bytes of data that is used for that track (16 bit = 2 bytes per word).

BYTES 0x0C-0x0F contains the offset from the start of the Track Data Header (BYTE 0x00,
which is the "T" in "TRK) to the flux data.  NOTE!!  THIS OFFSET IS *NOT* FROM THE
START OF THE FILE!

If there were more revolutions, there would be three more longwords stored for each
additional revolution.. example:

BYTES 0x10-0x1B would be the 2nd entry (duration2, length2, offset2).
BYTES 0x1C-0x27 would be the 3rd entry (duration3, length3, offset3).
BYTES 0x28-0x33 would be the 4th entry (duration4, length4, offset4).
BYTES 0x34-0x3F would be the 5th entry (duration5, length5, offset5).

Note that image types with FLAGS bit 3 set (READ/WRITE capability) only uses a single
revolution, but the space allocated for the flux data will be the maximum necessary to
store the worst case requirement.  The actual flux data will be inside of this space
and the current length will be accurate.  This allows the track to expand and contract
inside of the allocated space without overlapping and corrupting the file.

Flux data for each revolution is always stored sequentially (like the disk is spinning
multiple times) with SuperCard Pro's imager..  No break or skew occurs.  However, it is
possible that flux data could be located anywhere in the file because everything is
offset based.  For simplicity, please try to keep the revolutions sequential.  SuperCard
Pro's imaging software always stores the revolutions sequentially.
 

After the last byte of flux data there will be a timestamp.  This timestamp is an
ASCII string, ie: 1/05/2014 5:15:21 PM
