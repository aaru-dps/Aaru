  This format was defined in 1998 as a cooperative effort  between  several
emulator people,  mainly  Per  Hakan  Sundell  (author  of  the  CCS64  C64
emulator),  Andreas  Boose  (of  the  VICE  CBM  emulator  team)  and   Joe
Forster/STA  (the  author  of  Star  Commander).  It  was  the  first  real
cooperative attempt to create a format for  the  emulator  community  which
removed almost all of the drawbacks of the other  existing  image  formats,
primarily D64. The G64 format is not specifically  designed  to  hold  only
1541 images, but they are presently the only G64 images  in  existance  and
why this document only refers to the 1541 and D64's.

  The intention behind G64 is not to replace the widely used D64 format, as
D64 works fine with the vast majority of disks in existence. It is intended
for those small percentage of programs which demand to work with  the  1541
drive in a non-standard way, such as reading or writing data  in  a  custom
format. The best example is with speeder software such as Action  Cartridge
in "warp save" mode or Vorpal and V-MAX which write  track/sector  data  in
another format other than  standard  GCR.  The  other  obvious  example  is
copy-protected software which looks for some specific data on a track, like
the disk ID, which is not stored in a standard D64 image.

  One protection method that G64 has trouble emulating  is  data  alignment
between tracks. Some  protection  methods  rely  on  data  being  in  exact
positions when the head is stepped from one track to another.  Imagine  two
concentric circles representing the data tracks, with a drive head  reading
data from one track, stepping over to the other track and expecting to find
some specific data where it is now. Unless you can read track data  from  a
1541 so it is aligned with the  previous  track,  write  it  into  the  G64
appropriately, and also read the resulting G64 data with this alignment  in
mind, the protection check will likely fail. Other methods like  weak  bits
are also hard to emulate.

  G64 has a deceptively simply layout for what it is capable of  doing.  We
have a signature, version byte, some predefined size values, and  a  series
of offsets to the track data and speed zones. It is what's contained in the
track data areas and speed zones which is  really  at  the  heart  of  this
format.

  Each track data area is simply the raw stream of GCR data, just what  the
read head would see when a diskette is rotating past it. How the data  gets
interpreted is up to the program trying to access  the  disk.  Because  the
data is stored in such a low-level manner, just about anything can be done.
Most tracks will be in the standard format with  with  SYNC  markers,  GAP,
header, data blocks and checksums. The arrangement of the data when  it  is
in a standard GCR sector layout is covered at the end of this document.  It
is the tracks that don't follow the standard which are the reason for G64's
existance and the hardest to decode.

  Below is a dump of the  header,  broken  down  into  its  various  parts.
Following that is a breakdown of the track offset  and  speed  zone  offset
areas, as they demand much more explanation.

  Bytes: $0000-0007: File signature "GCR-1541"
               0008: G64 version (presently only $00 defined)
               0009: Number of tracks in image (usually $54, decimal 84)
          000A-000B: Maximum track size in bytes in LO/HI format

  Now, why are there 84 tracks defined when a normal D64 disk only  has  35
tracks? By definition, an image of a 1541 must include all the tracks  that
a real 1541 can access, which is at most 42 tracks and 42 half tracks. Even
though using more than 35 tracks is not typical, it was important to define
this format from the start with what the 1541 is capable of doing, and  not
just what it typically does. Some 1541 drives  may  have  problems  reading
past track 40, and pushing  the  head  past  track  42  might  be  somewhat
hazardous to the health of the drive as the head could get stuck.

  The typical value seen for the maximum track size is 7928.  This  is  the
value used for 1541 images which use standard GCR encoding. This  value  is
determined by the fastest write speed possible (speed zone 0), coupled with
the average rotation speed of the  disk  (300  rpm),  and  assuming  normal
Commodore GCR data formatting. After some math, the  answer  that  actually
comes up is 7692 bytes. Allowing for a slower disk rotation of -3%, , which
would allow more data to be written, and  some  rounding,  7928  bytes  per
track was arrived at. 

  Even though it might appear so, it is very important to  know  that  this
maximum track size value is not a fixed or  hard-coded  value.  This  value
depends on the what the original  disk  was  and  the  GCR  encoding  used.
Non-1541 images such as SFD1001 or 8050 will result  in  different,  likely
larger, track sizes. Also, disks with non-standard GCR encoding like  those
using V-MAX can result in tracks exceeding 8000 bytes.

  Since it is a flexible format in both track count and  track  byte  size,
file sizes can vary greatly. However, given a few constants like 42  tracks
with no halftracks, a consistent track size of  7928  bytes  and  no  speed
offset entries, the typical file size will be 333744 bytes.

  In my investigation using MNIB (a utility by Markus Brenner  that  allows
you to nibble a 1541 diskette to  the  PC  in  G64  format)  on  a  cleanly
formatted 1541 disk (using the built-in 1541 format  command),  I  saw  the
following numbers, compared with the defaults that MNIB uses:

                Track Range  Avg Size  MNIB
                             (bytes)   Size
                -----------  --------  ----
                   1-17       ~7720    7692
                  18-24       ~7165    7142
                  25-30       ~6690    6666
                  31-         ~6270    6250

  Note that  the  first  size  number  (7720)  is  larger  than  previously
mentioned track size of 7692. Why? Likely the drive that I used  to  create
and nibble the clean disk was rotating a little bit  slower  than  300  RPM
(~299 RPM), so more data than normal was stored on each track. I calculated
the percentage difference between my numbers and the established  benchmark
of 7692, multiplied all my numbers by  this  factor,  and  arrived  at  the
following chart:

                Track Range   Size    MNIB
                             (bytes)  Size
                -----------  -------  ----
                   1-17       7692    7692
                  18-24       7139    7142
                  25-30       6666    6666
                  31-         6247    6250

  See how close the real numbers come to what MNIB uses?  I  can  attribute
the differences of a few bytes to  my  own  rounding  errors.  Therefore  I
conclude that the numbers MNIB uses can be taken as the standard  that  all
1541-compatible G64 tracks should be created with.

  All of the  above  calculations  are  shown  here  to  establish  a  safe
benchmark to create G64 images in the event that someday we can  copy  them
back to a real 1541 disk. If the G64 track size was  too  large,  it  might
happen that the track cannot be written back out. By using the  above  MNIB
track size numbers, this problem should be alleviated.

  Below is a dump of the first section of a G64 file, showing  the  offsets
to the data portion for each track and half-track entry.

  Bytes: $000C-000F: Offset  to  stored  track  1.0  ($000002AC,  in  LO/HI
                     format, see below for more)

          0158-015B: Offset to stored track 42.5 ($00000000)

  The track offsets rquire some explanation. When one is set to all 0's, no
track data exists for this entry. If there is a value, it  is  an  absolute
reference into the file (starting from the beginning of the file).

  If an image stored here only contains 35 tracks  (e.g.  a  standard  1541
disk), then all the offset values for track 35.5 and higher will be set  to
0. This can be used to detect the maximum track count when converting to  a
D64 image. Since D64's cannot hold over 40 tracks, and typically only  have
35, some information will be lost when converting a G64.

  From the track 1.0 entry we see it is set for $000002AC.  Going  to  that
file offset, here is what we see...

  Following the track data is filler bytes. In this  case,  there  are  368
bytes of unused space. This space can contain anything, but for the sake of
those wishing to compress these images for storage, they should all be  set
to the same value. In the sample I used, these are all set to $FF.

  Below is a dump of the end of the track 1.0 data area.  Note  the  actual
track data ends at address $20B9, with the rest of the block being  unused,
and set to $FF.

  Bytes: $015C-015F: Speed zone entry for track 1 ($03,  in  LO/HI  format,
                     see below for more)
          0160-0163: Speed zone entry for track 1.5 ($03)
             ...
          02A4-02A7: Speed zone entry for track 42 ($00)
          02A8-02AB: Speed zone entry for track 42.5 ($00)

  Starting at $02AC is the first track entry (from above, it is  the  first
entry for track 1.0)

  The speed offset entries can be a little more complex. The 1541 has  four
speed zones defined, which means the drive can write data at four  distinct
speeds. On a normal 1541 disk, these zones are as follows:

        Track Range  Storage in Bytes    Speed Zone
        -----------  ----------------    ----------
           1-17           7820               3  (slowest writing speed)
          18-24           7170               2
          25-30           6300               1
          31-4x           6020               0  (fastest writing speed)


  Note that you can, through custom programming of  the  1541,  change  the
speed zone of any track to something different (change the 3 to  a  0)  and
write data differently.

  From the above speed zone sample, all the zones  use  4-byte  entries  in
lo-hi format. If the value of the entry is less than 4, then  there  is  no
speed offset block for the track and the value  is  applied  to  the  whole
track. If the value is greater than 4 then we have an  actual  file  offset
referencing a speed zone block for the track.

  In the above example shown, there were no offsets defined,  so  no  speed
zone block dump can be shown. However, I can define what should  be  there.
You will have a block of data, 1982 bytes long. Each  byte  is  encoded  to
represent the speed of 4 bytes in the track offset area, and is broken down
as follows:

  Speed entry $FF:  in binary %11111111
                               ֳֳֳֳ
                               ³ ³ ³ ³
                               ³ ³ ³ ְִ 4'th byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                               ³ ³ ְִִִ 3'rd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                               ³ ְִִִִִ 2'nd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                               ְִִִִִִִ 1'st byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)

  It was very smart of the designers of the G64 format  to  allow  for  two
speed zone settings, one in the offset block and another defining the speed
on a per-byte basis. If you are working with  a  normal  disk,  where  each
track is one constant speed, then  you  don't  need  the  extra  blocks  of
information hanging around the image, wasting space.


  What may not be obvious is the flexibility of this format to  add  tracks
and speed offset zones at will. If a program decides to write a  track  out
with varying speeds, and no speed offset exist, a new block will be created
by appending it to the end of the image, and the offset  pointer  for  that
track set to point to the new block. If a track has no offset yet,  meaning
it doesn't exist (like a half-track), and one needs to be added,  the  same
procedure applies. The location of the actual track or speed zone  data  is
not important, meaning they do not have to be in linear  order  since  they
are all referenced by the offsets at the beginning of the image.




Analysing the GCR data stream
-----------------------------

  Since the information stored in the track data area is in GCR format,  it
is not as simple to analyse as a normal 256-byte sector would be. Here is a
dump of a portion of the GCR data, and what to look for...

  We need to establish a marker by which one can  start  to  interpret  the
data. Always look for a group of at least 10 1-bits (two 'F's in a row  and
a bit more), as they establish the SYNC mark. The 1541 actually writes  out
a SYNC mark of 40 'on' bits (10 'F's in a  row).  Note  that  there  are  2
groups of SYNC marks quite close together, one for the  sector  header  and
one for the sector data. In the above example, there is 2 groups of "FF  FF
FF FF FF". The first one is the header SYNC and the second one is the  data
SYNC.

  An important point here: some documentation refers to  the  minimum  SYNC
mark as being at least 12 bits wide, and claims that one of  that  size  is
still not entirely reliable. Thus Commodore chose to use 40  bits  for  the
SYNC mark, making it impossible for the drive read electronics to miss.

  If the GCR data is not in the standard sector layout, then anything  goes
for interpreting the data. If no standard SYNC  mark  can  be  found,  then
there is no simple way to extract any useful data.


  Here's the layout of a standard low-level pattern on a 1541 disk. Use the
above example to follow along.

   1. Header sync   FF FF FF FF FF (40 'on' bits, not GCR encoded)
   2. Header info   52 54 B5 29 4B 7A 5E 95 55 55 (10 GCR bytes)
   3. Header gap    55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 (9 bytes, never read)
   4. Data sync     FF FF FF FF FF (40 'on' bits, not GCR encoded)
   5. Data bloc     55...4A (325 GCR bytes)
   6. Tail gap      55 55 55 55...55 55 (4 to 19 bytes, never read)
   1. Header sync   (SYNC for the next sector)


  The 10 header info bytes (#2) are GCR encoded and must be decoded down to
it's normal 8 bytes to be understood. Once decoded,  its  breakdown  is  as
follows:

   Byte  $00 - header block ID ($08)
          01 - header block checksum (EOR of $02-$05)
          02 - Sector# of data block
          03 - Track# of data block
          04 - Format ID byte #
          05 - Format ID byte #1
       06-07 - $0F ("off" bytes)

  The header gap (#3) is 8 bytes on an early model 1540/1541, but  9  bytes
on a later model 1541 and 4040. The 1541 doesn't read the header  gap,  but
simply waits it out to write out the  sector  data.  When  sector  data  is
written, the SYNC mark is re-written as well.

  There is some controversy over the header gap (#3). Most people assume it
to be 9 bytes of 0x55 characters, but the early 1540/1541 drives used  only
8. This caused an write incompatability with the existing 4040 disks of the
day. In 1541 ROM revision 901225-3 this error was fixed, and now all drives
write out 9 of the 0x55 characters for the gap. The book "Inside  Commodore
DOS"  by  Immers/Neufeld  documents  the  write  incompatibilty  and   what
corruption happens at a low level when writing to a disk with a header  gap
of 8 bytes on a disk that normally expects a gap of 9 bytes.

  The tail gap (#6) is the unused space between the end of one  data  block
and the start of the next. It will vary in size depending on what track you
are on, how fast the drive that created the disk was rotating at, and  what
program was used to format the disk. The stock 1541 format code is supposed
to determine how big a track is and divide up the extra unused  space  into
each tail gap. However, many disks will show a much larger tail gap between
the last sector and sector 0. In tests that the author conducted on a  real
1541 disk, gap sizes of 8 to 19 bytes were seen.


  The 325 byte data block (#5) is GCR encoded and must be  decoded  to  its
normal 260 bytes to be understood. For comparison, ZipCode Sixpack  uses  a
326 byte GCR sector (why?), but the last byte (when properly rearranged) is
not used. The data block is made up of the following:

  Byte    $00 - data block ID ($07)
       01-100 - 256 bytes sector data
          101 - data block checksum (EOR of $01-100)
      102-103 - $00 ("off" bytes, to make the sector size a multiple of 5)


  The most reliable way to read G64 track data is to read it as  bits,  not
bytes as there is no way to be sure that all the data is byte-aligned. This
simulates the way a 1541 drive reads data as well as the  head  only  reads
bits as well. The starting location of the track data is know, as  well  as
the track size so the boundaries of the track limits (start  and  end)  are
obtainable.

  What follows is a very simply  point-form  list  of  how  to  read  data,
finding sync marks, header blocks and sector blocks.

    1. Search for SYNC (at least 10 or more 1 bits)
    2. Check for header id after SYNC (GCR 0x52)
    3. If header, read the remaining 9 header bytes
    4. Decode header and get sector value
    5. Search for SYNC again
    6. Check for data id after SYNC (GCR 0x55).
    7. If data, read and store with previous header.
    8. Have we finished reading the track... stop
    9. Start over
