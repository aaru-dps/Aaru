<center><h1>The QCOW2 Image Format</h1></center>

<p>
The QCOW image format is one of the disk image formats supported by
the QEMU processor emulator. It is a representation of a fixed size
block device in a file. Benefits it offers over using raw dump
representation include:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Smaller file size, even on filesystems which don't support
  <i>holes</i> (i.e. sparse files)</li>
  <li>Copy-on-write support, where the image only represents changes made
  to an underlying disk image</li>
  <li>Snapshot support, where the image can contain multiple snapshots
  of the images history</li>
  <li>Optional zlib based compression</li>
  <li>Optional AES encryption</li>
</ol>

<p>
The qemu-img command is the most common way of manipulating these
images e.g.

<pre>
  $> qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.qcow2 4G
  Formating 'test.qcow2', fmt=qcow2, size=4194304 kB
  $> qemu-img convert test.qcow2 -O raw test.img
</pre>
</p>

<h2>The Header</h2>

<p>
Each QCOW2 file begins with a header, in big endian format, as follows:

<pre>
  typedef struct QCowHeader {
      uint32_t magic;
      uint32_t version;

      uint64_t backing_file_offset;
      uint32_t backing_file_size;

      uint32_t cluster_bits;
      uint64_t size; /* in bytes */
      uint32_t crypt_method;

      uint32_t l1_size;
      uint64_t l1_table_offset;

      uint64_t refcount_table_offset;
      uint32_t refcount_table_clusters;

      uint32_t nb_snapshots;
      uint64_t snapshots_offset;
  } QCowHeader;
</pre>

</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first 4 bytes contain the characters 'Q', 'F', 'I' followed
  by <tt>0xfb</tt>.</li>

  <li>The next 4 bytes contain the format version used by the
  file. Currently, there has been two versions of the format,
  version 1 and version2. We are discussing the latter here,
  and the former is discussed at the end.</li>

  <li>The <tt>backing_file_offset</tt> field gives the offset from the
  beginning of the file to a string containing the path to a file;
  <tt>backing_file_size</tt> gives the length of this string, which
  isn't a nul-terminated. If this image is a copy-on-write image, then
  this will be the path to the original file. More on that below.</li>

  <li>The <tt>cluster_bits</tt> fields them, describe how to map an
  image offset address to a location within the file; it determines
  the number of lower bits of the offset address are used as an index
  within a cluster. Since L2 tables occupy a single cluster and
  contain 8 byte entires, the next most significant <tt>cluster_bits</tt>,
  less three bits, are used as an index into the L2 table. the L2
  table. More on the format's 2-level lookup system below.</li>

  <li>The next 8 bytes contain the size, in bytes, of the block device
  represented by the image.</li>

  <li>The <tt>crypt_method</tt> field is 0 if no encryption has been
  used, and 1 if AES encryption has been used.</li>

  <li>The <tt>l1_size</tt> field gives the number of 8 byte entries
  available in the L1 table and <tt>l1_table_offset</tt> gives the
  offset within the file of the start of the table.</li>

  <li>Similarily, <tt>refcount_table_offset</tt> gives the offset to
  the start of the refcount table, but <tt>refcount_table_clusters</tt>
  describes the size of the refcount table in units of clusters.<li>

  <li><tt>nb_snapshots</tt> gives the number of snapshots contained in
  the image and <tt>snapshots_offset</tt> gives the offset of the
  <tt>QCowSnapshotHeader</tt> headers, one for each snapshot.
</ul>

<p>
Typically the image file will be laid out as follows:

<ul>
  <li>The header, as described above.</li>

  <li>Starting at the next cluster boundary, the L1 table.</li>

  <li>The refcount table, again boundary aligned.</li>

  <li>One or more refcount blocks.</li>

  <li>Snapshot headers, the first boundary aligned and the following
  headers aligned on 8 byte boundaries.</li>

  <li>L2 tables, each one occupying a single cluster.</li>

  <li>Data clusters.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>2-Level Lookups</h2>

<p>
With QCOW, the contents of the device are stored in
<i>clusters</i>. Each cluster contains a number of 512 byte sectors.
</p>

<p>In order to find the cluster for a given address within the device,
you must traverse two levels of tables. The L1 table is an array of
file offsets to L2 tables, and each L2 table is an array of file
offsets to clusters.</p>

<p>So, an address is split into three separate offsets according to
the <tt>cluster_bits</tt> field. For example, if <tt>cluster_bits</tt>
is 12, then the address is split up as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the lower 12 is an offset within a 4Kb cluster</li>

  <li>the next 9 bits is an offset within a 512 entry array of
  8 byte file offsets, the L2 table. The number of bits needed
  here is given by <tt>l2_bits = cluster_bits - 3</tt> since the L2
  table is a single cluster containing 8 byte entries</li>

  <li>the remaining 43 bits is an offset within another array of 8
  byte file offsets, the L1 table</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note, the minimum size of the L1 table is a function of the size of
the represented disk image:
<pre>
 l1_size = round_up(disk_size / (cluster_size * l2_size), cluster_size)
</pre>
</p>

<p>In other words, in order to map a given disk address to an offset
within the image:

<ol>
  <li>Obtain the L1 table address using the <tt>l1_table_offset</tt>
  header field</li>

  <li>Use the top (64 - <tt>l2_bits</tt> - <tt>cluster_bits</tt>) bits
     of the address to index the L1 table as an array of 64 bit
     entries
  </li>

  <li>Obtain the L2 table address using the offset in the L1
  table</li>

  <li>Use the next <tt>l2_bits</tt> of the address to index the L2
     table as an array of 64 bit entries</li>

  <li>Obtain the cluster address using the offset in the L2 table.
  </li>

  <li>Use the remaining cluster_bits of the address as an offset
  within the cluster itself</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the offset found in either the L1 or L2 table is zero, that area of
the disk is not allocated within the image.
</p>

<p>
Note also, that the top two bits of each of the offsets found in
the L1 and L2 tables are reserved for "copied" and "compressed"
flags. More on that below.
</p>

<h2>Reference Counting</h2>

<p>
Each cluster is reference counted, allowing clusters to be freed
if, and only if, they are no longer used by any snapshots.
<p>

<p>
The 2 byte reference count for each cluster is kept in cluster sized
blocks. A table, given by <tt>refcount_table_offset</tt> and
occupying <tt>refcount_table_clusters</tt> clusters, gives the offset
in the image of each of these refcount blocks.
</p>

<p>
In order to obtain the reference count of a given cluster, you split
the cluster offset into a refcount table offset and refcount block
offset. Since a refcount block is a single cluster of 2 byte entries,
the lower <tt>cluster_size - 1</tt> bits is used as the block offset
and the rest of the bits are used as the table offset.
</p>

<p>
One optimization is that if any cluster pointed to by an L1 or L2
table entry has a refcount exactly equal to one, the most significant
bit of the L1/L2 entry is set as a "copied" flag. This indicates that
no snapshots are using this cluster and it can be immediately written
to without having to make a copy for any snapshots referencing it.
</p>

<h2>Copy-on-Write Images</h2>

<p>
A QCOW image can be used to store the changes to another disk image,
without actually affecting the contents of the original image. The
image, known as a copy-on-write image, looks like a standalone image
to the user but most of its data is obtained from the original
image. Only the clusters which differ from the original image are
stored in the copy-on-write image file itself.
</p>

<p>
The representation is very simple. The copy-on-write image contains
the path to the original disk image, and the image header gives the
location of the path string within the file.
</p>

<p>
When you want to read an cluster from the copy-on-write image, you
first check to see if that area is allocated within the copy-on-write
image. If not, you read the area from the original disk image.
</p>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

<p>
Snapshots are a similar notion to the copy-on-write feature, except it
is the original image that is writable, not the snapshots.
</p>

<p>
To explain further - a copy-on-write image could confusingly be called
a "snapshot", since it does indeed represent a snapshot of the
original images state. You can make multiple of these "snapshots" of
the original image by creating multiple copy-on-write images, each
referring to the same original image. What's noteworthy here, though,
is that the original image must be considered read-only and it is the
copy-on-write snapshots which are writable.
</p>

<p>
Snapshots - "real snapshots" - are represented in the original image
itself. Each snapshot is a read-only record of the image a past
instant. The original image remains writable and as modifications are
made to it, a copy of the original data is made for any snapshots
referring to it.
</p>

<p>
Each snapshot is described by a header:

<pre>
  typedef struct QCowSnapshotHeader {
      /* header is 8 byte aligned */
      uint64_t l1_table_offset;

      uint32_t l1_size;
      uint16_t id_str_size;
      uint16_t name_size;

      uint32_t date_sec;
      uint32_t date_nsec;

      uint64_t vm_clock_nsec;

      uint32_t vm_state_size;
      uint32_t extra_data_size; /* for extension */
      /* extra data follows */
      /* id_str follows */
      /* name follows  */
  } QCowSnapshotHeader;
</pre>

Details are as follows

<ul>
  <li>A snapshot has both a name and ID, represented by strings (not
  zero-terminated) which follow the header.</li>

  <li>A snapshot also has a copy, at least, of the original L1 table
  given by <tt>l1_table_offset</tt> and <tt>l1_size</tt>.</li>

  <li><tt>date_sec</tt> and <tt>date_nsec</tt> give the host machine
  <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> when the snapshot was created.<li>

  <li><tt>vm_clock_nsec</tt> gives the current state of the VM
  clock.</li>

  <li><tt>vm_state_size</tt> gives the size of the virtual machine
  state which was saved as part of this snapshot. The state is saved
  to the location of the original L1 table, directly after the image
  header.</li>

  <li><tt>extra_data_size</tt> species the number of bytes of data
  which follow the header, before the id and name strings. This is
  provided for future expansion.</li>

</ul>

<p>
A snapshot is created by adding one of these headers, making a copy of
the L1 table and incrementing the reference counts of all L2 tables
and data clusters referenced by the L1 table. Later, if any L2 table
or data clusters of the underlying image are to be modified - i.e. if
the reference count of the cluster is greater than 1 and/or the
"copied" flag is set for that cluster - they will first be copied and
then written to. That way, all snapshots remains unmodified.
</p>

<h2>Compression</h2>

<p>
The QCOW format supports compression by allowing each cluster to be
independently compressed with zlib.
</p>

<p>
This is represented in the cluster offset obtained from the L2 table
as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the second most significant bit of the cluster offset is 1,
  this is a compressed cluster</li>

  <li>The next <tt>cluster_bits - 8</tt>of the cluster offset is the
  size of the compressed cluster, in 512 byte sectors</li>

  <li>The remaining bits of the cluster offset is the actual address
    of the compressed cluster within the image</li>
</ul>

<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>
The QCOW format also supports the encryption of clusters. 
</p>

<p>
If the crypt_method header field is 1, then a 16 character password
is used as the 128 bit AES key.
</p>

<p>
Each sector within each cluster is independently encrypted using AES
Cipher Block Chaining mode, using the sector's offset (relative to the
start of the device) in little-endian format as the first 64 bits of
the 128 bit initialisation vector.
</p>

<h2>The QCOW Format</h2>

<p>
Version 2 of the QCOW format differs from the original version in
the following ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>It supports the concepts of snapshots; version 1 only had the
  concept of copy-on-write image</li>

  <li>Clusters are reference counted in version 2; reference
  counting was added to support snapshots</li>

  <li>L2 tables always occupy a single cluster in version 2;
  previously their size was given by a <tt>l2_bits</tt> header
  field</li>

  <li>The size of compressed clusters is now given in sectors instead
  of bytes</li>
</ol>
