     * "Exception: Attempted to divide by zero." when opening a CUE/TRK image. The cue itself was hardcoded to a
     * specific path that I changed to a relative one. ImgBurn and IsoBuster can read the files fine. The exact files
     * I used are in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tlixznMyuQiL_D57OLIDIPeX7a99yHqx?usp=sharing.
