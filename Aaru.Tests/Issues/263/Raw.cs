     * Trying to extract the files from a DICF image results in the error "Error reading file: Object reference not
     * set to an instance of an object." Dumping and extracting as ISO does work, but there are issues with that too.
     * Full logs of dumping the disc as DICF and ISO, trying to extract the images, and comparing them are here:
     * https://pastebin.com/AuKum4QR.
     * Link to the image files themselves: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXlhV-EUVrSg-ceKi0xI7t5OAdGWvH9_/view?usp=sharing
