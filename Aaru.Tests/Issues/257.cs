     * Trying to convert an NRG image to various images formats fails in various ways. Converting it to ISO prints
     * "Converting sectors X to Y in track 1 (XX.XX% done)Error Writing sectors with tags is not supported. writing
     * sector X, continuing..." several times. Converting to MDS doesn't result in any visible errors in the log, but
     * DIC is unable to identify the file system in the resulting image. Converting to DICF prints "Converting sectors
     * 0 to 64 in track 1 (0.00% done)Error Incorrect data size writing sector 0, not continuing..." once before
     * stopping. DIC is able to extract the files from the original image so it seems to be good.
