     * Trying to convert an MDF/MDS file pair that is CD-ROM XA that has 2 tracks results in the program crashing
     * with the command window having been spammed with "Converting sectors x to x in track 2 (xx.xx% done)Error
     * Can't found track containing x writing sector x, continuing..." before the crash. A very similar crash occurs
     * when dumping the disc to MDF/MDS. The image is dumped correctly when using the BIN/CUE format. I have had the
     * same issue with similar CD-ROM XA discs, but seemingly only if they had multiple tracks. I attached all the logs
     * and I'll try to get a link to the image file up ASAP, let me know if you need anything else!
