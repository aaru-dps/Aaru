DiscImageChef is a fully featured media dump management solution. You usually know media dumps
as disc images, disk images, tape images, etc.

With DiscImageChef you can analyze a media dump, extract files from it (for supported
filesystems), compare two of them, create them from real media using the appropriate drive,
create a sidecar metadata with information about the media dump, and a lot of other features
that commonly would require you to use separate applications.

System requirements
===================
DiscImageChef should work under any operating system where there is [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/)
or [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
It has been tested using Mono 5.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1. However recommended versions are
Mono 5.8 and .NET Framework 4.7.1. .NET Core is unsupported.

Usage
=====

DiscImageChef.exe 

And read help.

Or read the [wiki](https://github.com/claunia/DiscImageChef/wiki).

Features
========
* Analyzes a disk image getting information about the disk itself and analyzes partitions and filesystems inside them
* Can checksum the disks (and if optical disc, separate tracks) user-data (tags and metadata coming soon)
* Can compare two disk images, even different formats, for different sectors and/or metadata
* Can list and extract contents from supported filesystems
* Can read several disk image formats.
* Can read several known sector by sector formats with variable bytes per sector.
* Can read standard sector by sector copies for optical and magnetic discs with constant bytes per sector.
* Can verify sectors or disk images if supported by the underlying format
* Can dump media from ATA, ATAPI, SCSI, USB, FireWire and SDHCI drives (magnetic disks, optical discs, magnetoptical disks, flash devices, memory cards and tapes) to several supported image formats.
* Can convert between image formats.
* Include an opensource archival image format with compression and deduplication.
* Can create standard open XML metadata from existing images.
* Can measure readability and speed of media (same that can be dumped, MHDD style)
* Has an online database with drive capabilities, and can report the capabilities of any drive.
* Works on any operating system and architecture where Mono or .NET Framework is supported (drive access requires Windows, Linux or FreeBSD).
* Has a graphical interface (work in progress)
