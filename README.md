Aaru is a fully featured media dump management solution. You usually know media dumps as disc images, disk images, tape
images, etc.

With Aaru you can identify a media dump, extract files from it (for supported filesystems), compare two of them, create
them from real media using the appropriate drive, create a sidecar metadata with information about the media dump, and a
lot of other features that commonly would require you to use separate applications.

System requirements
===================
Aaru is created using .NET Core 3.1 and can be compiled with all the major IDEs. To run it you require to use one of the
stable releases, or build it yourself.

Usage
=====

aaru.exe

And read help.

Or read the [documentation](https://www.aaru.app).

Features
========

* Identifies a disk image getting information about the disk itself and shows information about partitions and
  filesystems inside them
* Can checksum the disks (and if optical disc, separate tracks) user-data (tags and metadata coming soon)
* Can compare two disk images, even different formats, for different sectors and/or metadata
* Can list and extract contents from supported filesystems
* Can read several disk image formats.
* Can read several known sector by sector formats with variable bytes per sector.
* Can read standard sector by sector copies for optical and magnetic discs with constant bytes per sector.
* Can verify sectors or disk images if supported by the underlying format
* Can dump media from ATA, ATAPI, SCSI, USB, FireWire and SDHCI drives (magnetic disks, optical discs, magnetoptical
  disks, flash devices, memory cards and tapes) to several supported image formats.
* Can convert between image formats.
* Includes an open-source archival image format with compression and deduplication.
* Can create standard open XML metadata from existing images.
* Can measure readability and speed of media (same that can be dumped, MHDD style)
* Has an online database with drive capabilities, and can report the capabilities of any drive.
* Works on any operating system and architecture where .NET Core is supported (drive access requires Windows, Linux or
  FreeBSD).
* Has a graphical interface (work in progress)
