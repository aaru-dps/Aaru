/* Some information on the file format from Michal Necasek (www.os2museum.com):
 *
 * The HD-Copy diskette image format was used by the eponymous DOS utility,
 * written by Oliver Fromme around 1995. The HD-Copy format is relatively
 * straightforward, supporting images with 512-byte sector size and uniform
 * sectors per track count. A basic form of run-length compression is also
 * supported, and empty/unused tracks aren't stored in the image. Images
 * with up to 82 cylinders are supported.
 *
 * No provision appears to be made for single-sided images. The disk image
 * is stored as a sequence of compressed tracks (where a track refers to only
 * one side of the disk), and individual tracks may be left out.
 *
 * The HD-Copy RLE compression works as follows. The image is divided into a
 * number of independent blocks, one per track. Each compressed block starts
 * with a header which contains the size of compressed data (16-bit little
 * endian) and the escape byte. Whenever the escape byte is encountered in the
 * byte stream, it is followed by a data byte and a count byte.
 *
 * Note that HD-Copy uses RLE compression for sequences of as few as three
 * bytes, even though that provides no benefit.
 *
 * It would be tempting to perform in-place decompression to save memory.
 * Unfortunately the simplistic RLE algorithm means the encoded data may be
 * larger than the decoded version, with unknown worst case behavior. Hence
 * the compressed data for a sector may not fit into a buffer the size of the
 * uncompressed sector.
 *
 * There is no signature, hence heuristics must be used to identify a HD-Copy
 * diskette image. Fortunately, the HD-Copy header is highly recognizable.
