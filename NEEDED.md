This is a list of hardware, software, and general information needed to expand and better support various unique
hardware and software configurations for Aaru. We accept donation of this hardware, or loans: paying for shipping is
greatly appreciated, but can make other arrangements depending on cost. For media, we do accept loans, but please be
aware that due to it’s age, there is no guarantee it will still be working after it is returned and thus donations are
preferred.

Drives
======
This is a list of drives. The reason we need these drives is because it is the only way to add enhanced support for
them (e.g. media detection, ECC support, raw dumping, etc.). Also some drives depart from the specifications and need
special workarounds. If a drive is listed here, but the media it uses is not listed below, we already have media for it.
Drives are preferred in ATA/ATAPI, SCSI, USB or FireWire buses. Parallel port drives require a larger amount of work,
and there is no guarantee it can work, at all, with other drives. If in doubt, please contact us.
